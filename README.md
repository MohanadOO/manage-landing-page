## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) - UI library
- [SwiperJs](https://swiperjs.com/) - Slider library

### Useful resources

- [SwiperJs React Docs](https://swiperjs.com/react) - This helped set up the slider and modify the styles to fit the project for different breakpoints.

- [Headless UI Menu Docs](https://headlessui.dev/react/menu) - Headless UI is very easy to setup that's why I use it to create the navigation menu.
